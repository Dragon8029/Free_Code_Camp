Actually background images isn't scroll. Trick is simple.
Each section’s container div has fixed background image with background-size:cover property like this.
#home-section {
    background-image: 'test.png';
    background-position : fixed;
    background-size : cover;
}
This creates illusion when page scrolling.

It should be
background-attachment: fixed;
and not:
background-position: fixed;
